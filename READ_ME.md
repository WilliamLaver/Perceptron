# Implementations of the Perceptron algorithm for data classification

perceptron.py does not work properly.

perceptron2.py functions for 2 dimensional datasets

perceptron3D.py produces a correct classifier but the plotting function
contains errors.

perceptron_circle.py is an implementation of the kernel perceptron that is
incomplete so far.
